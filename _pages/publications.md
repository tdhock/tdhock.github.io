description: Peer-reviewed papers and preprints with links to code and data

- My pages on
  [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=c83d8tgAAAAJ)
  and
  [Mathematics Genealogy Project](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=224469).
- Peer review notice: in addition to peer-reviewed journals, I publish
  papers at machine learning conferences such as ICML and NeurIPS, which
  have double-blind peer reviews, and only accept about 20% of
  submitted papers.
- Reproducible Research notice: a "Reproducible" link for each paper below
  provides source code and data that I used to perform the analysis and make
  the figures/tables.
- Software notice: a "Software" link for each paper below provides a software
  package with a reference implementation of the algorithms described
  in our paper. See also my [Software](https://tdhock.github.io/software/) page.
- Please download my [TDH-refs.bib](/assets/TDH-refs.bib) BibTeX
  citation database, and use it to cite my papers. This is the file
  that was used to
  [generate](https://tdhock.github.io/blog/2024/auto-pubs-page/) the
  list of publications below.

## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'refs.wide' not found

```
## Error: 'refs.wide' is not found in calling scope and it is not a column name either. When the first argument inside DT[...] is a single symbol (e.g. DT[var]), data.table looks for var in calling scope.
