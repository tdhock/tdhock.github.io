Research interests: fast, accurate, and interpretable algorithms for
learning from large data, using continuous optimization (clustering,
regression, ranking, classification) and discrete optimization
(changepoint detection, dynamic programming). The main application
domains for these algorithms are genomics, neuroscience, medicine,
microbiome, cybersecurity, robotics, satellite/sonar imagery,
climate/carbon modeling.

I think reproducible research is important, so in addition to every
paper I write, I also provide

- A reference implementation of the algorithm(s) described in the paper, typically as an R package.
- Source code for doing the analyses and creating the figures, typically in a GitHub repo.

For more info about my research activities, see my
[publications](publications/) and [software](software/).

See my [teaching](https://tdhock.github.io/teaching/) page for lists
of university course materials, university research students
supervised, and Google Summer of Code students mentored.

As the leader of [Data Table Ninjas](https://datatableninjas.com/), I
also provide consulting services related to R `data.table`,
including big data analysis, machine learning, data visualization, and
teaching specialized programming classes related to these subjects.
