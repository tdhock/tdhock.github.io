title: Configuring eduroam
description: On cell phones and linux
---

Today I am working from ENS Paris-Saclay, where there is eduroam wifi.

To connect to eduroam, I used my credentials from UniversitÃ© de
Sherbrooke, but the method was slightly different between my laptop
(Ubuntu), and my telephone (iOS).

For iOS, Settings -> Wifi -> eduroam then

* Username: CIP@usherbrooke.ca (where CIP=abcd1234 etc)
* Password: usual sherbrooke password.

Then on the Certificate screen, tap Trust.

For Ubuntu, Settings -> Wifi -> eduroam then

* Authentification: PEAP
* Domaine: usherbrooke.ca
* Check no certificate required.
* Username: CIP@usherbrooke.ca (where CIP=abcd1234 etc)
* Password: usual sherbrooke password.

Then it should work!
