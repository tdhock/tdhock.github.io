title: Configuring eduroam
description: On cell phones and linux
---

Today I am working from ENS Paris-Saclay, where there is eduroam wifi.

To connect to eduroam, I used my credentials from UniversitÃ© de
Sherbrooke, but the method was slightly different between my laptop
(Ubuntu), and my telephone (iOS).

For iOS, Settings -> Wifi -> eduroam then

* Username: CIP@usherbrooke.ca (where CIP=abcd1234 etc)
* Password: usual sherbrooke password.

Then on the Certificate screen, tap Trust.

For Ubuntu, Settings -> Wifi -> eduroam then

* Authentification: PEAP
* Domaine: usherbrooke.ca
* Check no certificate required.
* Username: CIP@usherbrooke.ca (where CIP=abcd1234 etc)
* Password: usual sherbrooke password.

Then it should work!

## Update 10 Sept 2025

There is [a new procedure](https://www.usherbrooke.ca/services-informatiques/repertoire/reseaux/reseau-sans-fil/eduroam#c9606).

IPHONE

* download geteduroam app (SURF B.V.)
* choose Universite de Sherbrooke
* enter username (CIP) and password
  * it says to use votreCIP@usherbrooke.ca but it seems to have worked with just CIP (without @usherbrooke.ca).
* allow permissions to add network

Linux

* go to eduroam.app or [Eduroam CAT Tool](https://cat.eduroam.org)
